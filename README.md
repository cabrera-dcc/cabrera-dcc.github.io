=====================

What's this place?
------------------

Welcome! This is a [responsive website][2] built on [HTML5][3] with [CSS3][4], [jQuery][5] and some [jQuery UI][6] components. Its style sheets have been generated using [Stylus][7], a CSS preprocessor.

What's its purpose?
-------------------

Simple! I just wanted a place where I could briefly introduce myself and share some projects with others. So I had the idea of creating a website to do this.

And what the license about?

The website and its contents is under a [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License][8]. However, other licenses can be applied for other contents or components like some types of software or style sheets.

Nice to meet you. Come in and take a look!
